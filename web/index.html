 <p id="famInfo"> The above picture is of my two kids.  My wife and I have a 6 year old son and a 2 year old daughter.  We have been married for 9 years.  Our family lives in Sacramento, CA where I work in the workers' compensation insurance field and my wife stays home with the children. <br><br>
  We love to spend time with each other.  We enjoy going on walks and bike rides, and going to the river.  Both my wife and I are going to BYU Idaho online.  I am studying Software Engineer and my wife is studying Family Life Studies.
